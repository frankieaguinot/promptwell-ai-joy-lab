## 🧠 My Framework: Human-Centered AI  
I believe successful AI must be:  

- **Accessible** – Usable by anyone, regardless of technical skills  
- **Empowering** – Helps people do more, learn more, and express themselves  
- **Iterative** – Encourages experimentation, play, and learning by doing  
- **Ethical** – Designed with empathy, privacy, and transparency first  

Here on GitHub, I share my practical approaches and notes on designing for humans first in the age of AI.
